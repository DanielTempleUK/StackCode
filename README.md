StackCode
=========

Repository to hold the code I produce for Stack Overflow answers.

Some of this code made it to SO answers, some of it never did. 
I probably wasn't the fastest gun in the west when I was playing with my answer.

For completeness, I should add my [SO profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2508646/dan-temple)
